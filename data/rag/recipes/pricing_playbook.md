# What this is

A strategic pricing framework for digital products based on value, market positioning, and customer psychology.

# When to use

- Setting prices for new products
- Repositioning existing offers
- Creating product ladders (tripwire → core → premium)
- Planning launch discounts

# 5-step build recipe

1. **Research market**: Check 5-10 competitors in your niche
2. **Value calculation**: List all benefits and transformations your product provides
3. **Tier selection**: Choose tripwire, core, or premium positioning
4. **Test pricing**: Start at the higher end, can always lower later
5. **Plan discounts**: Early-bird, bundle, seasonal promotions

# Outline template

```
Product Ladder:
- Tripwire: €7-€19 (impulse buy, lead gen)
- Core: €29-€99 (main offer, builds trust)
- Premium: €99-€299 (full transformation)
```

# Pricing tiers

- **Tripwire**: €7-€19 - Quick win, easy yes
- **Core**: €29-€99 - Main offer, solves core problem
- **Premium**: €99-€299 - Complete solution, VIP experience

# Quarterly plans

Multiply monthly price by 2.2-2.5× for quarterly billing:
- Monthly €29 → Quarterly €69 (saves customer €18)
- Monthly €99 → Quarterly €249 (saves customer €48)

# Launch tactics

- **Early-bird**: 30% off for first 48 hours
- **Scarcity**: Bonuses expire after X sales or Y days
- **Money-back guarantee**: 7-14 days to reduce risk
- **Bundle discount**: Buy 2-3 products together, save 20-30%

# Common mistakes

- Pricing too low (devalues your expertise)
- No price anchoring (show original vs. discounted price)
- Too many options (decision paralysis)
- No urgency (no reason to buy now)

# Metrics to watch

- Average order value (AOV)
- Conversion rate by price point
- Cart abandonment rate
- Refund rate by tier

# Quick prompts

"Suggest 3 pricing tiers for [product type] targeting [audience] with [budget/time constraints]."

Example: "Suggest 3 pricing tiers for meal prep guide targeting busy professionals with €50-150 budget."
