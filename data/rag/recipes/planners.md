# What this is

A planner is a structured, printable or fillable digital product that helps users organize tasks, goals, habits, or specific workflows (e.g., meal planning, budget tracking, goal setting).

# When to use

- **High demand niches**: Productivity, fitness, finance, meal prep
- **Recurring value**: Users print/use weekly, monthly, or daily
- **Low creation time**: Templates are reusable and scalable
- **Passive income**: Sell on Etsy, Gumroad, or your own site

# 5-step build recipe

1. **Choose planner type**: Daily, weekly, monthly, or niche-specific (meal prep, budget, fitness)
2. **Design 10-15 pages**: Cover, instructions, 5-10 planner pages, notes/trackers
3. **Create templates**: Use Canva, PowerPoint, or design tools (ensure print-ready)
4. **Add value extras**: Stickers, habit trackers, goal-setting worksheets
5. **Export as PDF**: Fillable (digital) or printable (high-res for printing)
