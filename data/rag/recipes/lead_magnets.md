# What this is

A lead magnet is a free or low-cost ($0-€7) digital product offered in exchange for an email address. It's designed to attract your ideal customer and build your email list.

# When to use

- **List building**: Grow email list from 0 to 500+ subscribers
- **Funnel entry**: First touchpoint before paid offers
- **Authority building**: Showcase expertise and build trust
- **Segmentation**: Different lead magnets for different audiences

# 5-step build recipe

1. **Identify quick win**: One specific problem you can solve in 5-10 minutes
2. **Create 3-7 pages**: Short, actionable, high-value content
3. **Design for skimmability**: Bullet points, checklists, templates
4. **Add email capture**: Landing page with opt-in form
5. **Set up automation**: Deliver instantly via email

# Outline template

```
- Title: [Quick win] in [timeframe]
- Promise: Clear benefit (e.g., "Save 5 hours per week")
- Content: 1-3 actionable tips or templates
- CTA: Invite to paid offer or next step
```

# Lead magnet types

- **Cheat sheet**: 1-page quick reference guide
- **Checklist**: Step-by-step task list
- **Template**: Fillable document (budget, planner, script)
- **Mini eBook**: 5-10 pages with one focused topic

- **Resource list**: Curated tools, apps, or links

# Pricing

- **Free**: Build list (requires opt-in)
- **Tripwire**: €3-€7 (paid lead magnet, filters serious buyers)

# Common mistakes

- Too long (people want quick wins, not homework)
- Too broad (vague topic, not solving ONE specific pain)
- No CTA (no next step after consuming lead magnet)
- Poor delivery (broken links, long wait times)

# Metrics to watch

- Opt-in conversion rate (landing page visitors → subscribers)
- Download rate (subscribers who actually download)
- Email-to-customer conversion (lead magnet → paid buyer)
- Unsubscribe rate (quality of list)
