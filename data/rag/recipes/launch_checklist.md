# What this is

A step-by-step launch system to take your digital product from idea to first sales in 7-14 days.

# When to use

- Launching your first product
- Re-launching an updated version
- Seasonal product releases
- Beta testing with early adopters

# 5-step build recipe

1. **Pre-launch (Days 1-3)**: Validate hook, collect 50-100 waitlist emails
2. **Build phase (Days 4-7)**: Create product, design, proofread, export
3. **Launch setup (Days 8-10)**: Set up checkout, email sequence, landing page
4. **Launch week (Days 11-14)**: Send 5-email sequence, engage audience
5. **Post-launch (Days 15+)**: Gather feedback, update v1.1, add upsell

# Outline template

```
Pre-Launch:
☐ Validate idea with 10 target customers
☐ Create landing page teaser
☐ Collect 50-100 emails
☐ Survey audience for pain points

Build:
☐ Complete draft content
☐ Design cover/visuals
☐ Proofread (or hire editor)
☐ Export final files (PDF, etc.)
☐ Set up checkout page

Launch (5-email sequence):
☐ Email 1: Tease (problem + coming soon)
☐ Email 2: Story (your journey + why this matters)
☐ Email 3: Reveal (launch announcement + benefits)
☐ Email 4: FAQ (address objections)
☐ Email 5: Last chance (urgency + scarcity)

Post-Launch:
☐ Thank buyers, ask for feedback
☐ Update v1.1 based on input
☐ Plan upsell or next product
```

# Launch tactics

- **Early-bird discount**: 30% off first 48 hours
- **Limited bonuses**: First 50 buyers get extra templates
- **Social proof**: Share testimonials as they come in
- **Scarcity**: Timer on landing page, bonus expires
- **Money-back guarantee**: 7-14 days to reduce risk

# Common mistakes

- No pre-launch list (launching to empty room)
- Too long between announcement and sale (momentum dies)
- No urgency or scarcity (no reason to buy now)
- Ignoring feedback (missing improvement opportunities)
- No follow-up sequence (one email then silence)

# Metrics to watch

- Waitlist signups (pre-launch interest)
- Email open rates (engagement)
- Landing page conversion (visitors → buyers)
- First 48-hour sales (momentum indicator)
- Customer feedback scores (satisfaction)
