# What this is

Promotional emails are designed to convert your email subscribers into buyers. They build anticipation, address objections, and create urgency around your product launch.

# When to use

- **Product launches**: 5-7 email sequence
- **Seasonal promotions**: Black Friday, New Year
- **Re-engagement**: Win back inactive subscribers
- **Upsells**: Promote related products to existing customers

# 5-step build recipe

1. **Tease (Email 1)**: Introduce the problem, hint at solution coming soon
2. **Story (Email 2)**: Share your journey, why you created this product
3. **Reveal (Email 3)**: Launch announcement, what's included, benefits
4. **FAQ (Email 4)**: Address common objections and questions
5. **Last chance (Email 5)**: Urgency, scarcity, final call-to-action
