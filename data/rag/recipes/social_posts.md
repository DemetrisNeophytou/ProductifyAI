# What this is

Social media posts to promote your digital product on platforms like Instagram, Facebook, Twitter/X, LinkedIn, and TikTok.

# When to use

- **Pre-launch buzz**: Build anticipation 7-14 days before launch
- **Launch day**: Announce availability

- **Limited offers**: Flash sales, bonuses, discounts

# 5-step build recipe

1. **Problem post**: Identify the pain your audience faces (relatable, emotional)
2. **Solution teaser**: Hint at your product, build curiosity
3. **Launch post**: Announce product, clear CTA, link in bio
4. **Testimonial post**: Share customer success stories, before/after
5. **Last chance post**: Urgency, scarcity, final reminder

# Platform-specific tips

- **Instagram**: Visual-first, carousel posts (swipe for tips), stories with polls
- **LinkedIn**: Professional tone, case studies, value-driven content
- **Twitter/X**: Short threads, bite-sized tips, quote tweets
- **TikTok**: Short videos (15-60s), behind-the-scenes, quick wins
- **Facebook**: Community-focused, longer posts, group engagement

# Common mistakes

- Too promotional (all sales, no value)
- No clear CTA (people don't know what to do next)
- Inconsistent posting (sporadic, loses momentum)
- No engagement (post and ghost)
- Wrong platform for audience (LinkedIn for B2C teens)

# Metrics to watch

- Engagement rate (likes, comments, shares)
- Click-through rate (link in bio clicks)
- Reach/impressions (visibility)
- Conversion rate (social → sale)

# Quick prompts

"Write 5 social media posts for [product] to [audience] on [platform]."

Example: "Write 5 Instagram posts for meal prep planner to busy parents launching next Monday."
