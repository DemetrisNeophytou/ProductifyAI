Please update and improve the app based on the following strategic requirements inspired by Iman Gadzhi’s methodology:
	1.	Positioning: Specialized vs Generic AI
	•	Make it clear throughout the app (homepage, dashboard, onboarding, marketing copy) that generic AI tools like ChatGPT are for everyday tasks, but our AI is a specialized tool for creating and monetizing digital products.
	•	The app should emphasize that users don’t need expertise — the AI guides them step by step to produce ebooks, courses, apps, or other digital products.
	2.	User Experience Flow
	•	Transform the AI experience from “just answering questions” into a guided structured process.
	•	The AI should walk users through the exact steps needed to create a finished product, not just give advice.
	•	Include a strong focus on outcomes rather than generic responses.
	3.	Competitive Advantage Messaging
	•	Integrate the key ideas from Iman’s slides directly into the UX and copywriting, for example:
	•	“The quality of your tools determines the quality of your outcomes.”
	•	“Choose the wrong tool and you’ll be swimming across the Atlantic. Choose the right tool and you’ll be in Manhattan before dinner.”
	•	“Specialized tools eliminate the need for expertise entirely.”
	•	“With the right tools, you can create digital products without being an expert.”
	4.	Monetization Strategy (Stripe Integration)
	•	Ensure that the subscription tiers highlight the specialization advantage.
	•	Free/Trial tier = very limited usage, just to show potential.
	•	Pro tier (€49.99/month or €119.99/3 months) = full specialized features with guided AI that delivers ready-to-use digital products.
	5.	Performance & Responsiveness
	•	The AI should be fast, engaging, and conversational (like ChatGPT-5), not slow or generic.
	•	Optimize dashboard buttons, prevent errors/fails when clicking, and ensure a smooth real-time response from the AI.

Goal:
When a user compares our app to ChatGPT, they must immediately see that ChatGPT is generic while our app is specialized, outcome-driven, and built specifically for digital product creators.
