Project name: Productify AI — Your Digital Product Factory

Goal: Build an AI-powered web app that creates digital products (eBooks, mini-courses, guides, templates). Everything generated must be fully editable by the user (content + design) before export.

Tech (you choose best defaults):
React (or Next.js) + Tailwind, Node/Express API, PostgreSQL (or Supabase), File storage, Auth (email/Google), OpenAI API. Use environment secret OPENAI_API_KEY.

Core flows:
	1.	Auth & Onboarding

	•	Email/Google sign-in.
	•	Onboarding to set Brand Kit (logo upload, primary/secondary colors, fonts, tone of voice).

	2.	New Product Wizard

	•	Choose product type: eBook / Course outline & slides / Checklist / Notion or Canva template / Lead magnet.
	•	Choose niche + goal + target audience + tone.
	•	If eBook, follow this exact framework (editable & re-orderable):
	•	Introduction
	•	Real Cause of the Problem
	•	Solution Mechanism
	•	The Damaging Admission
	•	Product
	•	Transition
	•	Offer
	•	CTA + Scarcity
	•	Bonuses
	•	Guarantee
	•	Urgency
	•	Options

	3.	AI Generation

	•	Call OpenAI to generate structured sections.
	•	Auto-fill cover title, subtitle, bullets, TOC.
	•	Also generate marketing assets: sales page outline, CTA blocks, 3 email angles, 10 hooks.

	4.	Full Editing (must-have)

	•	Rich text editor (TipTap/Quill) with: headings, lists, tables, images, callouts, drag-and-drop reorder sections.
	•	Design panel: change theme colors, fonts, spacing, page size; pick from templates.
	•	Images:
	•	Upload your own
	•	Pick from stock/Unsplash (if available)
	•	AI image generation prompt box to replace cover or background.
	•	Background: toggle solid/gradient/image/video; live preview.

	5.	Assets Manager

	•	Library for images/covers/brand kit.
	•	Replace any image/background with one click; update reflected across the document.

	6.	Exports

	•	Export PDF, DOCX, Markdown, HTML, and ZIP (assets + HTML).
	•	For courses: export slide deck (PDF) + lesson scripts (DOCX/MD).

	7.	Projects Dashboard

	•	List, rename, duplicate, delete products.
	•	Status badges (Draft/Final).
	•	Autosave versions + “Restore previous”.

	8.	Settings

	•	Brand Kit editor (logo/colors/fonts).
	•	Default tones/styles (e.g., bold/direct, friendly, luxury).
	•	API key stored as secret OPENAI_API_KEY (no key in client).

	9.	Pricing (placeholder)

	•	Basic: free limited generations
	•	Pro: unlimited generations + exports
(Just scaffold Stripe routes; actual billing later.)

UX Notes:
	•	Everything generated must be editable.
	•	Keep layout simple: left sidebar (Sections), center editor, right panel (Design).
	•	Provide live preview for cover & pages.

Environment/Secrets required:
	•	OPENAI_API_KEY (server only).
	•	If using Supabase: SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY (optional).
	•	If using image stock: UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY (optional).

Acceptance test:
	•	Create an eBook → the framework sections appear → user can edit text, reorder sections, change background, replace images, switch theme, then export PDF/DOCX.
	•	AI marketing assets are created in a side tab and are also editable.
