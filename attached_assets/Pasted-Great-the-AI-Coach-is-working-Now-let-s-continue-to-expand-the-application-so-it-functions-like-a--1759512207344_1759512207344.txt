Great, the AI Coach is working. Now let’s continue to expand the application so it functions like a full digital product creation platform. Please implement the following next steps:

1. Project Workspace Integration
	•	Add a new section in the sidebar: “My Projects”.
	•	Inside a project, show tabs:
	1.	Outline → Generate a structured outline with /api/generate-outline.
	2.	Content → Generate and expand chapters/lessons with /api/write-chapter.
	3.	Design → Apply brand kit (colors, fonts, logo).
	4.	Export → Export the finished product as a clean PDF.

2. AI-Powered Content Expansion
	•	Add backend endpoints:
	•	/api/write-chapter → Generates full text for a chapter/lesson.
	•	/api/expand → Expands user’s text with more detail, examples, or better flow.
	•	The content should keep the Digital Product Strategist persona.

3. Export Functionality
	•	Implement Export as PDF with professional formatting (title page, chapters, footer with branding).
	•	Later, add export to Google Docs or HTML.

4. Templates
	•	Create starter templates:
	•	Ebook template (10 chapters).
	•	Course template (6 modules × 3 lessons each).
	•	Workbook template.
	•	Users should be able to choose a template when creating a new project.

5. Subscription & Billing
	•	Integrate Stripe Checkout with 3 pricing tiers:
	•	Starter ($29/mo) → 5 projects, limited AI tokens.
	•	Pro ($79/mo) → unlimited projects, all templates.
	•	Studio ($199/mo) → 3 team seats, brand kits, white-label exports.
	•	Add a Billing page with “Manage Subscription”.

6. AI Suggestions (UX Boost)
	•	Inside the editor, add small AI suggestions (example: “Consider adding a bonus module” or “Expand this chapter with more case studies”).
	•	These should be generated by calling a small AI endpoint /api/suggest.

With these features, the app will:
	1.	Let users create a real product (ebook, course, workbook).
	2.	Write, expand, and improve content with the AI Coach.
	3.	Apply branding and export as a professional PDF.
	4.	Monetize with subscriptions through Stripe.
