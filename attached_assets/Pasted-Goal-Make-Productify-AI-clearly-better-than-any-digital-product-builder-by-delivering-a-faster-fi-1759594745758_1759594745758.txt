Goal: Make Productify AI clearly better than any “digital product builder” by delivering a faster first win, richer templates, frictionless checkout, visible results, and role-based AI that feels like a team.
Important: In all user-facing copy/UI do not reference competitors or specific creators. Internally we can take inspiration, but the brand voice must be 100% ours.

0) Non-negotiables (keep existing app safe)
	•	Use feature flags for every new module (flags.ts): onboardingV2, templateVault, missionControl, revenueCounter, paymentsV2, aiAgentsGrid, quickActions, seoOneClick, imageGen, costCalc.
	•	No breaking changes: wrap new endpoints under /api/v2/*.
	•	Model config: read from env OPENAI_MODEL (default to our current model). Never hard-code.
	•	Cost control: add MAX_TOKENS, RESPONSE_MODE=fast|quality, request logging + per-user rate limits.
	•	Copy guideline: never mention other platforms/people in UI.

1) Interactive Onboarding (first win ≤90 seconds)

Why: Dramatically reduce drop-off; users must feel progress instantly.
Flow (4 steps, single page wizard):
	1.	“What do you want to create?” → eBook | Mini-Course | Template Pack | Playbook | Newsletter
	2.	AI returns 3 validated ideas with scores (Pain, Money, Speed, Access).
	3.	User picks one → AI generates Offer Snapshot (title, promise, 3 bullets, 3-tier pricing, revenue math).
	4.	One-click Create Project → lands in editor with draft outline + cover.

Deliverables
	•	components/onboarding/CreatorWizard.tsx
	•	POST /api/v2/ai/validate-idea
	•	POST /api/v2/ai/generate-offer

Acceptance
	•	From fresh account to ready draft in ≤90s on mid phone.
	•	Progress bar + confetti “First win unlocked”.

⸻

2) Template Vault (ship fast)

Why: Users convert when they feel 80–90% done.
Categories (minimum at launch):
	•	eBook (10 layouts)
	•	Mini-Course (5 outlines)
	•	Sales Page (15 sections)
	•	Email Sequences (welcome, launch x5, nurture; 20 total)
	•	Lead-magnet (checklists, swipe files; 10)

One-click actions
	•	“Use this template” → pre-fills editor.
	•	“AI Polish Copy”, “AI Generate Images”, “AI SEO Optimize”, “AI Add Upsells”.

Deliverables
	•	modules/templates/* JSON schema with metadata (use-cases, length, tone).
	•	POST /api/v2/ai/enhance with mode: 'polish'|'images'|'seo'|'upsells'.

Acceptance
	•	Library searchable by niche/result.
	•	Any template → usable draft in <3s.

⸻

3) AI Agents Grid (role-based, not generic chat)

Why: Feels like a team; lowers intimidation.
Cards (minimum 7):
	•	Idea Finder 💡
	•	Offer Crafter 💰
	•	Content Writer ✍️
	•	Launch Manager 🚀
	•	Funnel Planner 🎯
	•	AI Coach 🧠
	•	Analytics Agent 📈

Each card opens a guided panel (left inputs, right AI output with smart defaults).
System prompts live in /prompts/<agent>.md (concise, with do/don’t + JSON output schema).

Acceptance
	•	Each agent returns structured JSON + a copy/paste block.
	•	No raw “AI rambling”; outputs are clean sections (headlines, bullets, CTAs, etc.).

⸻

4) “Mission Control” Dashboard

Why: Clarity → momentum.
Widgets:
	•	Revenue Counter (dummy until we connect payments; explain privacy).
	•	Quick Actions: Generate New Product (30s), Clone Best Seller, Launch Promo.
	•	Progress Tracker with micro-wins & badges.
	•	Cost-Savings Calculator (“All-in-one vs piecemeal tools” — generic, no brand names).

Deliverables
	•	pages/dashboard.tsx (mobile-first), modules/calc/cost.ts.

Acceptance
	•	Initial data loads <1s (use skeletons/cache).
	•	Badges awarded on first draft, first publish, first checkout connect, first sale.

⸻

5) Payments & Checkout (frictionless)

Why: Money in = product is real.
Phase A (now): Stripe)
	•	One-click Connect with Stripe (Standard).
	•	Multi-currency (€, $, £).
	•	Taxes: enable Stripe Tax if available; otherwise simple VAT note.
	•	Checkout links generator per product.

Phase B (later flag): Merchant-of-Record integration
	•	If we integrate a MoR later, UI copy stays generic (“Global tax handled”).

Deliverables
	•	POST /api/v2/payments/create-checkout-link,
	•	GET /api/v2/payments/stats.

Acceptance
	•	User can publish product + share checkout link in <5 min.
	•	Test mode & live mode toggles; clear error states.

⸻

6) Social Proof & “Success Wall”

Why: Proof drives action.
	•	Live earnings counter (aggregate or “creators have earned this month”).
	•	Wins gallery (snippets: “Published in 2 hours”, “First sale in 3 hours”)
	•	Result carousels (before/after copy, launch screenshots).

Deliverables
	•	modules/proof/successWall.tsx, seed with demo data; live mode later.

Acceptance
	•	Switchable demo/live.
	•	Shareable: /success page with OpenGraph.

⸻

7) One-Click Publish & SEO

Why: Remove last-mile friction.
	•	Built-in landing page for every product (clean theme).
	•	SEO one-click: title, meta desc, OG image, schema JSON-LD.
	•	Cover image: AI-generated (brand-safe, no copyrighted logos).

Deliverables
	•	pages/p/[slug].tsx, POST /api/v2/ai/seo, POST /api/v2/ai/cover.

Acceptance
	•	Lighthouse SEO ≥ 95 on mobile.
	•	Share link looks pro by default.

⸻

8) Growth Tools
	•	Lead magnet generator (PDF + cover).
	•	5-Email Launch Sequence (cold→warm→close).
	•	Social snippets (X, IG, TikTok hooks) w/ 3 styles (direct, story, authority).
	•	Affiliate ready (IDs in checkout links; basic leaderboard later).

⸻

9) Quality, Performance, Safety
	•	Stream AI responses; hard timeout 25s; 2 retries with jitter; graceful fallbacks.
	•	Autosave & Version history (store deltas).
	•	i18n initial: English + Greek UI + content tone toggle.
	•	Accessibility: keyboard nav, ARIA, color-contrast AA.
	•	Privacy: clear copy about data use; redact PII in logs.

⸻

10) Fix & Harden (existing issues you may see)
	•	“Objects are not valid as a React child” → audit components rendering raw objects; always JSON.stringify or map arrays; add <ErrorBoundary>.
	•	“Method is not a valid HTTP token.” → ensure no Method header; it’s method on fetch. Ensure Authorization: Bearer ${key} is correct.
	•	401 on API key → env OPENAI_API_KEY + OPENAI_MODEL; add health check /api/v2/ai/health.
	•	Add a thin OpenAI client with sane defaults (streaming, retries, abort controller).
