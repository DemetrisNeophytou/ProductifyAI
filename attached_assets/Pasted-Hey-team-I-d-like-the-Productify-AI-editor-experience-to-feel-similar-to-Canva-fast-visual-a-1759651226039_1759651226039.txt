Hey team 👋

I’d like the Productify AI editor experience to feel similar to Canva — fast, visual, and intuitive — but focused entirely on digital products (ebooks, workbooks, courses, and landing pages).

Please review these links only as design/UX inspiration:
	•	https://www.canva.com → drag-and-drop editor and instant preview
	•	https://www.notion.so → clean block-based editing flow
	•	https://systeme.io → digital-product creation and selling flow

⚠️ Important: Do not copy or reuse any design assets, code, or layouts.
These links are only to understand the feel, spacing, and interaction logic.

🧭 Goal

The user should feel that they can:
	1.	Create a new product (ebook, course, landing page, etc.)
	2.	See it instantly generated by the AI
	3.	Edit text or images directly on the canvas (inline, WYSIWYG style)
	4.	Move blocks around easily (drag-and-drop outline on the left)
	5.	Customize colors, fonts, and logo (Brand Kit panel on the right)
	6.	Preview and export (PDF/DOCX/HTML) in one click

⸻

🧩 Editor Layout to Implement
	•	Left Panel (Outline / Sections):
List of product sections (Introduction, Chapter 1, etc.) with drag-and-drop reordering.
	•	Main Canvas (Center):
Live block-based editor with inline editing and placeholders for images.
Blocks: text, image, list, quote, CTA.
	•	Right Panel (AI Tools):
Tabs:
	•	✏️ Edit / Improve / Shorten / Expand
	•	🖼️ Regenerate Image
	•	🎨 Brand Kit (colors, fonts, logo upload)
	•	💬 AI Suggestions (ideas or rewrite options)
	•	Top Bar:
Save • Undo/Redo • Export • Preview • Settings

⸻

⚙️ Core Behaviors
	•	Live preview updates instantly as the user edits
	•	Autosave every 5 seconds
	•	Version history for each project
	•	Keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl+Z (Undo), Ctrl+Y (Redo), Ctrl+S (Save)
	•	Smooth transitions (fade in/out on AI-generated updates)

⸻

🧠 AI Integration
	•	Keep using GPT-5 with streaming for fast, incremental text generation
	•	AI should handle:
	•	Full draft generation
	•	Regenerate single sections
	•	Suggest new blocks or visuals
	•	Apply brand tone automatically

⸻

✅ End Result

A Canva-style interactive editor that allows users to:
	•	Generate a full ebook/course automatically
	•	Edit, redesign, and export it visually
	•	Feel in control like Canva, but focused on creating profitable digital products.

Let’s start with the Ebook Editor version first (MVP). Once stable, we’ll extend the same layout to workbooks, landing pages, and course scripts.
