Hey team, I want my Productify AI app to evolve into a best-in-class digital product platform, better than Monetise, Gumroad, and The Leap.

Please study the competitive analysis & roadmap I’m attaching. The goal is to integrate the best elements from each competitor, but make them unified and seamless inside my app.

Implementation priorities:

PHASE 1 (Week 1-2):
- Add 90-second onboarding flow (choose product → AI validates → AI builds offer → publish → get paid).
- Show live scoring (Pain, Money, Access, Speed).
- AI generates first idea + 3-tier pricing with revenue math.
- One-click publish to template store.

PHASE 2 (Week 3-4):
- Add “AI Mission Control” dashboard with:
  - Real-time revenue tracker
  - 7 AI agent cards (Idea Finder, Offer Crafter, Content Writer, Funnel Planner, Launch Manager, AI Coach, Analytics Agent).
- Quick Actions strip: "Generate New Product", "Clone Best Seller", "Launch Promo".
- Cost Savings Calculator (compare vs competitors).

PHASE 3 (Week 5-6):
- Template Library (at least 15 templates: eBooks, courses, sales pages, email sequences).
- One-click AI enhancements: Polish Copy, Generate Images, SEO Optimize, Add Upsells.
- Speed Metrics: "Product created in 47 sec", "First sale in 3h".

PHASE 4 (Week 7-8):
- Payment & checkout integration like Lemon Squeezy:
  - Global tax compliance
  - Multi-currency + 20+ payment methods
  - Instant payouts (PayPal/Stripe)
  - 0% platform fees → emphasize "keep 100% of revenue".

PHASE 5 (Week 9-10):
- Social Proof & Results section:
  - Live revenue counter
  - Creator spotlights with testimonials + revenue numbers
  - 10X Guarantee Badge.

PHASE 6:
- Unique AI Differentiators:
  - "GPT-5 Powered" Badge
  - Built-in Iman Gadzhi’s 7 profitability filters
  - Always-on chat bubble: “Ask me anything about your product”.

IMPORTANT:
- Keep the app **simple and fast** (no clutter).
- Prioritize user-first wins in <90 seconds.
- Make UI visually show cost savings and speed advantages vs competitors.
- Optimize prompts with High Power Model (GPT-5) for content-heavy tools (Content Writer, Offer Builder, Funnel & Launch, AI Coach).

The goal is: When people see my app, they should say “this is clearly better than Monetise or Gumroad”.
