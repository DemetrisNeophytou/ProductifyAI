I am building a Monetize-style app on Replit, but it must go further:

It needs to have a specialized AI inside, just like “Digital Product Creator 2.0”, which is 100% focused on helping creators build, launch and scale digital products (ebooks, courses, memberships, templates).



The AI should act as a Digital Product Strategist — not just generate text. It must:



Give users strategic guidance (audience, positioning, pricing, upsells, launch plans).
Generate ready-to-use materials (outlines, chapters, sales copy, emails, launch calendars).
Help them design and brand their products inside the app.
Be able to expand/improve their content on demand.
Export everything cleanly to PDF/HTML inside the app.




End Goal: Users can create a full digital product and launch plan inside the app without leaving it — so they can realistically make $100k+/year from digital products.

The AI feels specialized and strategic, not generic text generation.
