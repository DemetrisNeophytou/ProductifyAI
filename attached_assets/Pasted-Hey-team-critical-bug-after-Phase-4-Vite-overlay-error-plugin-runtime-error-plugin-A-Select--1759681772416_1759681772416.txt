Hey team — critical bug after Phase 4:

Vite overlay error:
[plugin:runtime-error-plugin] A <Select.Item /> must have a value prop that is not an empty string. This is because the Select value can be set to an empty string to clear the selection and show the placeholder.

Steps to reproduce (any of these trigger it):
1. Open Create → Basic Info / Details and interact with the dropdowns (e.g., Tone of voice, Product type).
2. In the Editor, switch tabs (AI Tools / AI Image / Brand Kit / AI Suggestions) when no block is selected.
3. Sometimes happens on first load after “Create Product”.

Please hot-fix with the following guardrails:
• Ensure all Select options are rendered with non-empty value (e.g. "professional", "casual", etc.).
• Initialize state with a valid default (no empty string for controlled Selects).const [tone, setTone] = useState<'professional'|'casual'|'inspirational'|'educational'|'conversational'>('professional');
When mapping options, skip falsy entries:
{options.filter(Boolean).map(o => (
<Select.Item key={o.value} value={o.value}>{o.label}</Select.Item>
))}
For Radix / shadcn Select, always provide value + onValueChange and never pass ''.
<Select value={tone} onValueChange={setTone}>
• If there’s no selected block in the editor, disable AI tabs and show a small hint “Select a section on the left to use AI tools” (prevent null refs).
• Add a global error boundary so the UI doesn’t crash on minor errors; show a friendly toast instead.
• Keep Vite overlay enabled in dev, but ensure production build is clean (no console errors).

Regression tests to add:
• E2E: create product → go through all 4 steps → open editor → switch between AI Tools / AI Image / Brand Kit / AI Suggestions with and without a selected block.
• Verify Pexels/Pixabay image actions work when API keys are present; otherwise show a clear “Connect API key” notice (no crash).
• Verify Stripe keys & credits banner render without hitting any Select defaults.

Please fix and push, then share a brief QA checklist + GIF of the flow working.
