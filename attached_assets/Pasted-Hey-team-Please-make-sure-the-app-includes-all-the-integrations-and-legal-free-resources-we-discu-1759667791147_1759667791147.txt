Hey team 👋
Please make sure the app includes all the integrations and legal-free resources we discussed.
The goal is to make Productify AI fully self-contained, legally safe, and powerful for digital product creation.
Here’s the complete list of what I want included:

⸻

📸 Media Sources (for photos & videos):
	•	Integrate Pexels API as the main photo source → https://www.pexels.com/api
(100% free for commercial use, no attribution required)
	•	Add Pixabay API as fallback → https://pixabay.com/api/docs
(also fully free and open-license)
	•	Use both APIs for image search inside templates, eBooks, and design sections.

⸻

🔤 Fonts & Typography:
	•	Integrate Google Fonts API → https://developers.google.com/fonts
	•	Allow users to choose fonts dynamically from Google Fonts inside the Brand Kit.
	•	All fonts must load dynamically and be applied globally across all templates, exports, and projects.

⸻

🎨 Icons & Graphics:
	•	Use only open-source icon libraries such as Lucide Icons, Heroicons, or Phosphor Icons.
	•	Replace any proprietary icon sets with these open-source alternatives.

⸻

🧩 Brand Kit Integration:
	•	Implement a complete Brand Kit system so users can:
	•	Upload their logo (PNG/SVG)
	•	Choose primary/secondary colors
	•	Select typography (from Google Fonts)
	•	Save preset styles (buttons, backgrounds, layout colors)
	•	All these should apply globally to all templates, exports, and projects.

⸻

📁 Export System:
	•	Users must be able to export:
	•	PDF (for eBooks)
	•	PNG/JPG (for images or mockups)
	•	HTML (for landing pages)
	•	Exports should maintain all brand styles and layout integrity, and be responsive on both desktop and mobile.

⸻

⚙️ Legal & Licensing Requirements:
	•	Only use APIs, fonts, and icons that are 100% free for commercial use and require no attribution.
	•	No external or non-licensed assets should be used anywhere in the app.

⸻

Goal:
The app should be fully ready for public beta after Phase 4 — with legal, open integrations and brand customization across all product types (ebooks, images, landing pages, etc.).

Thank you! 🙌
