📌 PRODUCT BRIEF — “AI Genius Studio” (AI-first Canva for digital products)

Goal: Deliver an AI-first creation experience (like Canva’s ease, but for digital products) that can auto-generate ebooks, courses, funnels/landing pages, and social assets from a short prompt, with full visual editing and 1-click export/publish.
