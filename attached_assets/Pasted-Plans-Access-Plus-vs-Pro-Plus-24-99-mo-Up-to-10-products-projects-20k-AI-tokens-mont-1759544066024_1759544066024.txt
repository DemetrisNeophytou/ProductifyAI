Plans & Access (Plus vs Pro)
	•	Plus (€24.99/mo)
	•	Up to 10 products/projects
	•	20k AI tokens/month (configurable)
	•	Core Builders (Idea Finder, Product Outline, Content Writer, Offer Builder)
	•	Basic Funnel & Launch Plan (one-page funnel + 5-day launch plan)
	•	Community access (read/write)
	•	Pro (€49.99/mo or €119.99/quarter)

	•	Advanced Funnel Kit (opt-in + sales + checkout copy + upsell/downsell copy)
	•	Priority AI speed (lower temperature + streaming + higher rate limits)
	•	Priority community badge & priority support

Trial: 3-day free trial for any new subscription (handled by Stripe).

Implementation Notes
	•	We already have Stripe products/prices. Use live Price IDs in client/src/pages/Pricing.tsx.
	•	Backend validates plan by Stripe Customer → active subscription → price lookup.
	•	Feature gates via role/plan in user session (e.g., plan: 'plus' | 'pro').
	•	Token quotas stored in DB per user per month; reset monthly (cron).

2) End-to-End User Flow (must be frictionless)
	1.	Landing → Sign up (email/password or OAuth).
	2.	Trial CTA → Stripe Checkout (3-day trial) → return to app.
	3.	Onboarding wizard (4 steps):
	•	Niche & goal (experience, interests, available time)
	•	Product type (ebook, course, template, micro-SaaS/app)
	•	Audience assumptions (beginner/intermediate/pro; B2B/B2C)
	•	Monetization preference (low-ticket €17-€47, mid €97-€297, high €497+)
	4.	Dashboard shows:
	•	“Next 3 Actions” (always 3 concrete tasks)
	•	Trial/subscription status card + upgrade/extend CTAs
	•	Quick links to Builders and Community
	5.	Builders produce outputs → user saves to Project
	6.	Funnel & Launch outputs → downloadable docs + copy/paste blocks
	7.	Community (left nav) → post, comment, like
	8.	Billing Portal for manage/upgrade/cancel (Stripe Portal)

5) Prompts (server-side, maintained centrally)

Create /server/prompts/ with JSON or TS modules. Examples:
