# Pricing Strategies for Digital Products

## Introduction

Pricing is the #1 lever for profitability in digital products. A small price change can double your revenue. This guide covers proven strategies for pricing ebooks, courses, templates, and digital downloads.

## Core Principles

### 1. Value-Based Pricing
**Price on transformation, not time invested.**

Examples:
- Ebook saves 20 hours of research → Price at $47-$97 (vs. $20 "per hour")
- Course enables $5K/month side income → Price at $297-$997 (10-20% of potential outcome)
- Template saves 10 hours of work → Price at $49-$149 (vs. designer at $50/hr)

**Formula**: Customer Value × 10-20% = Your Price

### 2. Perceived Value
Increase perceived value through:
- Professional packaging (cover, design)
- Bonuses and extras
- Scarcity (limited availability)
- Social proof (testimonials)
- Guarantee (money-back)

### 3. Price Anchoring
Show 3 options:
- **Basic**: $47 (anchor low)
- **Standard**: $97 (most popular - 60% choose this)
- **Premium**: $197 (anchor high)

The middle option sells best.

## Testing Prices

### A/B Testing
Test 2-3 price points:
- Group A: $47
- Group B: $67
- Group C: $97

Measure:
- Conversion rate
- Total revenue
- Customer feedback

**Winner**: Highest revenue (not highest conversion)

### Price Elasticity

- Higher price = Fewer sales (but more profit?)
- Find the sweet spot through testing
