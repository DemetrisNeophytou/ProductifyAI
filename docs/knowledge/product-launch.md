## Common Launch Mistakes

### ❌ Launching Too Soon

### ❌ No Email List
**Problem**: Launching to crickets  
**Fix**: Build list for 4-8 weeks minimum (goal: 100+ subscribers)

### ❌ Weak Sales Page
**Problem**: Traffic but no conversions  
**Fix**: Problem-agitate-solution format + social proof

### ❌ Ignoring Post-Launch
**Problem**: Sales drop off immediately  
**Fix**: Nurture buyers, collect testimonials, plan next launch

### ❌ One-Time Launch
